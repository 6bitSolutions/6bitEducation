                <h3>6 BIT REPLAY MARKING - PLATFORM TERMS</h3>
                <p>
                    App end-user licence agreement.
                </p>
                <h3>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING AND USING THE APP.</h3>
                <p>
                    This end-user licence agreement (<b>Terms</b>) is a legal agreement between you (<b>End-user</b> or <b>you</b>) and 6 BIT EDUCATION LTD, a company registered under number 12337063 and whose registered office is at Unit 48 Birmingham Research Park, Vincent Drive, Birmingham, United Kingdom, B15 2SQ (<b>Licensor</b>, <b>us</b> or <b>we</b>) for 6 BIT REPLAY MARKING PLATFORM (<b>Platform</b>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We licence use of the Platform to you on the basis of these Platform Terms and subject to any rules or policies applied by (i) any app store (e.g. iTunes or Google Play) (<b>Appstore</b>)  where the End-user downloaded the Platform (<b>Appstore Rules</b>) or by (ii) 6 BIT’s website, if the Platform is used through 6 BIT’s website or by any other authorised website (‘<b>Website Terms</b>’).  We do not sell the Platform to you.  We remain the owners or licensors of the Platform at all times.
                </p>
                <h3>Technical requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    This Platform requires a modern smartphone, functional laptop, tablet or computer, updated to an appropriate recent operating system. 
                </p>
                <h3>Important notice:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>By downloading the Platform or clicking on the "Accept" button below you agree to the terms of the licence which will bind you.  The terms of the licence include, in particular, the privacy policy referred to in clause 1.5 and the limitations on liability in clause 7.</li>
                    <li>If you do not agree to the terms of this licence, we will not license the Platform to you so you must uninstall the Platform or not download it.</li>
                    <li>The Platform is designed for use for your own guided learning through your school, college, University, or other learning body (<b>Your Institution</b>).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Using the Platform</h3>
                <p>
                    The Platform is a feedback platform designed to be used in the education sector, by educators and students.  The Platform learns how educators are marking and giving grades to their students and is enabling them to give feedback to their students through the Platform so that the educators will not have to give the same feedback again for the same question.  The Platform will remember both the question and the answer and will automatically give feedback to the students. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Platform is intended to be used to collect information such as (i) questions from the educators to their students and any type of assessment, (ii) answers from the educators to their students, and other information from your device.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Platform does not work on a standalone basis and is to be used under a chargeable service and only using user credentials under a valid and current subscription to 6 BIT (<b> BIT Cloud Service</b>).  
                    Users don’t pay directly to use the Platform, but Your Institution pays us for your subscription which will enable you to have access to the Platform through a unique user and a password.  The educators will then be able to assess their students through the Platform, give them feedback and mark their answers.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may as well show you ads of different products and services from different businesses and organisations, including Your Institution.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Platform is used to provide data that forms part of the 6 BIT Cloud Service.  We cannot guarantee that this data will be accurate, up to date and complete at all times.  A number of factors can impact on this such as whether the Device is switched on, network connectivity, data connectivity, network issues, bandwidth, and various other factors.  Whilst we are working to provide the best possible service, you should be aware of the potential limitations of this technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>You may retain or print a copy of these Platform Terms for future reference.</b>
                </p>
